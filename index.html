            Change and transformation are a constant, inevitable and ongoing part of life. At times, we need
            support. We will focus on helping you identify and understand your triggers to develop healthy
            coping skills and new ways of thinking. We will work on finding new ways for you to manage such
            feelings as being overwhelmed, anxious, depressed, stuck, afraid, stagnant, traumatized, in
            pain, reactive, angry, and/or resentful- as these feelings result in dysfunction and negatively
            impact relationships and wellness. Therapy is a process of discovery, growth and healing,
            developing your strengths, and releasing that which no longer serves you.

            Through deep weekly conversations we will identify your current issues, your triggers, and help
            you develop ways to deal with life in a better way- to help you live with more ease,
            contentment, joy and peace.

            holistic studies in Rhinebeck NY 2015-2019. EMDR trained.
