            Change and transformation are a constant, inevitable and ongoing part of life. At times, we need support. We
            will focus on helping you identify and understand your triggers to develop healthy coping skills and new
            ways of thinking. We will work on finding new ways for you to manage such feelings as being overwhelmed,
            anxious, depressed, stuck, afraid, stagnant, traumatized, in pain, reactive, angry, and/or resentful- as
            these feelings result in dysfunction and negatively impact relationships and wellness. Therapy is a process
            of discovery, growth and healing, developing your strengths, and releasing that which no longer serves you.

            Through deep weekly conversations we will identify your current issues, your triggers, and help you develop
            ways to deal with life in a better way- to help you live with more ease, contentment, joy and peace. I
            invite you to let me share my multi-faceted individualized approach with you to help you heal, work through
            your “stuff”, and find new comfort in your skin. In 2016, I completed my 200-hour yoga teacher training and
            have been seasonal service-corps at Omega institute for holistic studies in Rhinebeck NY 2015-2019. EMDR
            trained.
